Basics of computer science - C lab classes in 1 semester of Applied Computer Science, AGH
This repo contains my own solutions to the tasks I was given during lab classes of Basics of Computer Science course, which I took in the 1st semester of Applied Computer Science studies at AGH University of Cracow.
The point of the course (and of the tasks) was to learn about the C language, mainly about its syntax. 
The tasks concerned such topics as: using functions from library <string.h>, using of pointers, operations on arrays and loops.
